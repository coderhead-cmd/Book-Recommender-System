# Book-Recommender-System
This project develops a Book Recommendation System using data from Books, Users, and Ratings tables. After data cleaning and preprocessing, multiple recommendation techniques were implemented, including popularity-based, content-based, collaborative filtering, and a hybrid approach, to provide personalized and accurate book suggestions for readers.
